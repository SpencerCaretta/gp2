GGtrivia is a sudden death format trivia game that challenges the user to answer as many questions as possible before getting one wrong.  User can compete for the top spot on the leaderboard and submit their own questions to a separate sequelize table that we can add if we so choose.  GGtrivia utilizes Bootstrap, Animate.CSS, Sequelize, JQuery, Path, and Font Awesome.  Can YOU answer all the questions?  Good luck reaching the top!
